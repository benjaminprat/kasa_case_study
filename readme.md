### Question 2

The *.xlsx file below contains a couple of negative reviews from the last quarter. Please provide statistics about those reviews. If possible, create visualization(s), to make it easier to present your findings to Kasa management.

I created a few charts to highlight different data sets so conclusions can be made about the negative reviews. For purposes of time I created these charts using JS Fiddle

This bar chart displays the number of reservations by building and the average rating per building.
